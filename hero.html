Firefighters are men and women who risk there lives to put out fires and save thousands of lives. They strap up in there gear and head off into the burning flames pulling survivors out of the wreckage.
They are always quick responders to 911 calls and are quick to the action. Overall firefighters are true heros and are highly respected.

Firefighters are my hero because they actually saved my house. During the fires in big sur the fires were actuallly starting to come over my hill and almost get our house. 
Luckly the firefighters that risked there lives saved my house and put out the fire. Not only did they save my house but hundreds of more and millions of lves around the world. 
think firefighters are everybodys hero and should have the most respect and gratitude given to them.
