		Write and algorithm to create a guessing game.
		Let the user know if the guess is to high or too low.
		If they guess the number, alert this fact and tell them how many guesses it took them to guess the number.
		
		1.Generate a random number  and set the number of guesses to 0.
		2.Prompt the user to enter a guess
		3.Than check the users guess with the orginal generated number and if low prompt use it is to low. If to high prompt user it is to high. If correct prompt user they got it and how manny guesses it took them to get the random generated number.
		4. Loop while guess does NOT equal the number.
		(rand != usersguess) // == tests equality != tests if rand doens NOT EQUAL uG
	*/

	var numOfguesses = 0; // camel case
	var rand = Math.random()*10
	rand = rand + 1;
	rand = parseInt(rand);
		
	
	usersGuess = prompt("Guess a number from 1-10")
	numOfguesses++
	
	// = --> assignment open
	// == --> tests for equality
	// != --> test NOT equals
	
	while( usersGuess != rand ) // Loop while the users answer is wrong.
	{
		
		if ( usersGuess < rand ) // test if guess is to low.
		{	
			alert("Guess is to low.")// with an alert. tell the user the guess is to low.
